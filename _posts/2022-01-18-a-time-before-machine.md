i dream of a time before the machine//
before the gramophone, before dal√≠//
before the radio, before the gun//
before the newspaper, the phonograph, the film camera rolled into one//

i see the eye in the glass, the brain in the bottle//
consciousness weakened, curiosity throttled//
people exist to eat, sleep and procreate//
digesting digital palliatives of what they loathe and hate//

may synthetic pleasures for empty minds//
be the wreck of civilisation and the rise of a new divine//
