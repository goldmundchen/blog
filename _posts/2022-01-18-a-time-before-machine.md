I dream of a time before the machine
Before the gramophone, before Dal√≠
Before the radio, before the gun
Before the newspaper, the phonograph, the film camera rolled into one

I see the eye in the glass, the brain in the bottle
Consciousness weakened, curiosity throttled
People exist to eat, sleep and procreate
Digesting digital palliatives of what they loathe and hate

May synthetic pleasures for empty minds
Be the wreck of civilisation and the rise of a new divine
