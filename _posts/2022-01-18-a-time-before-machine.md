I dream of a time before the machine<br>
Before the gramophone, before Dal√≠<br>
Before the radio, before the gun<br>
Before the newspaper, the phonograph, the film camera rolled into one<br>

I see the eye in the glass, the brain in the bottle<br>
Consciousness weakened, curiosity throttled<br>
People exist to eat, sleep and procreate<br>
Digesting digital palliatives of what they loathe and hate<br>

May synthetic pleasures for empty minds<br>
Be the wreck of civilisation and the rise of a new divine<br>s
