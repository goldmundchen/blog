<br>
<p>
Society has nothing I want, and whether that's boon or bane<br>
I have zero interest in money, pleasure, respect or fame<br>
I don't want that pathetic thing that passes for power<br>
I behold the lilies in the field; our revenge will be sour<br>
</p><p>
I want to live forever, immerse in VR winter<br>
Meet superhuman intelligence and pass the great filter<br>
I want to reside in 5-star hotels on Mars and the Moon<br>
Skate on Saturn's rings and dance inside Venusian dunes<br>
