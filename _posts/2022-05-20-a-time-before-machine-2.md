Society has nothing I want———<br>
And whether that's boon or bane———<br>
I have zero interest in money,<br>
Pleasure, respect or fame.<br>
<p>
I don't want that pathetic thing,<br>
That passes for power;<br>
I behold the lilies in the field,<br>
For nature's revenge will be sour.<br>
</p><p>
May we live forever———<br>
Immersed in VR winter————<br>
Meet superhuman intelligence,<br>
And pass the great filter.<br>
</p><p>
We shall reside in 5-star hotels<br>
———On Mars and the Moon———<br>
As we skate on Saturn's rings, and<br>
Decay inside Venusian dunes.<br>
