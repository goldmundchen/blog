<blockquote>
  <p>“Nature loves courage. You make the commitment and nature will respond to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles. Dream the impossible dream and the world will not grind you under, it will lift you up. This is the trick. This is what all these teachers and philosophers who really counted, who really touched the alchemical gold, this is what they understood. This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall. This is how magic is done. By hurling yourself into the abyss and discovering it's a feather bed.”

― Terence McKenna</p>

I believe birds are far superior to us in both strength of spirit and mind,<br>
for birds's innate strive for freedom to move, speak and form alliances<br>
is second to none in nature.

Now look at us, what have we become?<br>
A mask-wearing breed of broken souls,<br>
cramped in 3D-folded buildings scraping the skies;<br>
driving good people to mental asylum.<br>

Self-imposed cages made of steel, reinforced concrete and curtain walls of glass,<br>
bringing us closer to heaven yet farther away from it than ever.<br>
Oh, what irony!

if anything, we should be looking up and around us,<br>
and learn from those freedom-loving birds dancing,<br>
who have witnessed the coming and going of human civilizations from far above,<br>
remaining true to their core nature through the cycles of history and the aeons of time.

I have nothing but love and deep admiration for those creatures of boundless beauty,<br>
who would carry themselves with such ease across the rainbows at full play;<br>
who, when the sun finally reveals itself behind thick clouds, would become excited;<br>
and, just like any other animal of high nobility, will refuse to live and breed in captivity,<br>
forever choosing death over confinement.

Like swans,<br>
clapping with the power of their wings as they land between the rivers with a great clang,<br>
fully aware that life is about so much more than mere survival and reproduction.

Maybe, just maybe, when you were in your happiest moment--<br>
free to act, think and speak as you please<br>
--you could feel this, too.

Indeed, life has nothing to do with mere survival or reproduction,<br>
which, if anything at all, are side effects of something higher.

Now look around you, what do you see?<br>
Slave-like misery reduced to a steaming ratpile,<br>
in places of 'peak civilization' like Tokyo or Chengdu,<br>
in striking contrast to the energies one can still sense in remote areas of SSA or SEA,<br>
where humans to this day love nothing more than to drive out into the open country,<br>
without roads, yet with colorful trails adorned by trees and flowers,<br>
who would consider modern day cultures and societies claustrophobic.

I have nothing else to say to you, except for this:<br>
amongst all values of relevance and meaning of homo sapiens--<br>
reproduction, survival, truth, love, narrative or progress<br>
--shall freedom to move, think and act, at no harm to others,<br>
be at all times your primary goal function and default state of mind.

Hail Freedom! Hail to the birds!
