<p>
Society has nothing I want, and whether that's boon or bane<br>
I have little interest in money, pleasure, respect or fame<br>
I don't want that pathetic thing that passes for power<br>
I behold the lilies in the field whilst 2D turns them sour<br>
</p><p>
I want to live forever, immerse in VR winter<br>
Meet superhuman intelligence and pass the great filter<br>
I want to reside in five-star hotels on Mars and the Moon<br>
Skate on Saturn's rings, dance inside Venusian dunes<br>
</p><p>
May synthetic pleasures for empty minds<br>
Be the wreck of civilisation and the rise of a new divine<br>
</p>
