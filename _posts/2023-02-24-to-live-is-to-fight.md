<br><i>
This free verse has been conceived in response to that which has defiled most men in ’modern society', who seem incurably infected by what is commonly referred to as the 'woke virus' of the mind.<br></i>
<p><i>
Understand this: Life is war, young soldier———and you must stand ready to fight. Don't let yourself be led astray of the noble path of man by those unholy forces weakening both spirit and mind. There is still hope.<br></i>
<hr /></p><p>
And off he sails, headed into war,<br>
Mothered by the night, and<br>
Guided by the stars.<br>
</p><p>
Upon gales of mighty fury,<br>
His senses sharp and keen;<br>
Sailing through the greatest winds,<br>
That man has ever seen.<br>
</p><p>
Armed with the spear of Mars,<br>
And protected by His shield;<br>
Winged afoot with Hermes' sandels,<br>
Made of imperishable gold.<br>
</p><p>
The moonlit sea, the raging storm,<br>
His will and his domain,<br>
Bend the sea———oh, God of waves!<br>
———and guide him through the rain.<br>
 </p><p>
A disciple of Eros———young God of passion<br>
And total destruction———<br>
Forever devoted<br>
To the irrepressible forces of life.<br>
</p><p>
Shall no law or word of man stand in his way,<br>
And may this be his wealth:<br>
A spear and shield of the God of war,<br>
Making him Great King.<br>
